IBM Data Science project in Python : Predicting House prices

Project Idea : This was one of the projects in the IBM Data Science certification course conducted by Coursera in collaboration with IBM. 
In this assignment, I am a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I am  tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. We will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. 
We will use Watson Studio to perform the analysis, and prepare a Jupyter notebook with a URL that can be shared. 

Resources used: Coursera certification course : https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science

Data Source : In the form of a series of csv files was provided in the Coursera Case study.

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

Tools used : Python, Jupyter Notebook and Watson Studio

ANALYSIS STEPS:

ASK - Problem description and SOW (see document : Scope of Work)

PREPARE - Data collection and organization. Data was downloaded from Coursera. Reading in the csv files into the Python (VS Code IDE) environment.

PROCESS - No cleaning was required for this dataset as it was prepared for this exercise by Coursera. Cleaning was not in the scope of this exercise.

ANALYZE - Created linear and non linear models. Evaluated each visually using Regression plots, Residual plots, Distribution plots and numerically using R-Squared (R^2) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) analysis. (see Jupyter Notebook script : ModelDevelopment.ipynb)

SHARE - Summarized findings, conclusions and recommendations in the same Jupyter Notebook

Note: I recreated the Jupyter notebook step by step in order to understand each step of the process (was not just a cut & paste exercise)
